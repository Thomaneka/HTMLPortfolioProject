  <h3>Learn More About Me</h3>
  <p>
    My name is Anton Thomanek and I began programming in March of 2017.
    I have so far enjoyed the process of creating new applications. I am
    looking forward to seeing what else I am able to accomplish once I
    have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and Ruby.
